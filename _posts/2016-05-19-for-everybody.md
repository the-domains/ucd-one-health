<article style=""><h1>Where can I get free Condoms</h1><p>With HIV and other STIs on the rise, particularly but not limited to Men who have sex with Men (MSM), it's good to know where to get condoms, and as you may be a broke College Student, where to get some free. </p></article>

**Where can I get free condoms?**

We know that students are broke and many places offer free condoms to promote safe sex, so we've made a list of these below. Free condoms are available to anybody aged seventeen or over at any of these organizations. Also Follow the [Just Carry One][0] ([http://www.facebook.com/justcarryone][0] ) STI prevention project on Facebook for competitions to win some condom goodies. Follow [Johnny's Got You Covered][1] ([http://www.facebook.com/justcarryone][0] )on facebook or on Twitter @thinkjohnny, for up-to-date information on events scheduled where free condoms are distributed.

## For Everybody:

1. **The Student Union**. In most Student Unions around the country and certainly in UCD they will have free condoms either at the desk or at the Welfare Office. Just drop in any time they're open, they're offices are located in the Old Student Centre.
2. **Fresher's Bags**. Need an excuse to join that 10th Society? Well for any of the main societies in UCD, there will be at least one in the bag, so whether it's L&H, Film, LawSoc, or LGBTQ+ they've got you covered.
3. **Fresher's Week Events**: Most society fresher's bags will have a condom in them, so this is one incentive to sign up to societies! There will also be people giving out condoms around campus, so it's a good idea to stock up.
4. **HIV Ireland.** Located at 70 Eccles Street, which is up from O'Connell Street, past the Garden of Remembrance and opposite the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, HIV Ireland are open from 9-5 Monday to Friday and you can call in anytime then to get free condoms. Again free HIV and STI testing is offered here the second and fourth Wednesday of every month (doors open from 1pm) and so you can pick up your condoms when there for an STI and HIV test or at any other time.

5. There are also places in Cork, Galway and Limerick that give out free condoms, see here ([http://www.dublinaidsalliance.ie/?page=access-free-condoms][3]) for details.

## Extra Places for MSM:

Whether you're on a night out and find yourself in need or you're going for a health checkup, these places got you covered.

1. **Outhouse LGBT Community Centre**. OutHouse is located in 105 Capel Street, Dublin 1, and is a community resource centre for LGBT people, their family and friends. You go up O'Connell Street until you reach Parnell Street, where you turn left and walk down Parnell Street until the end where it goes into Capel Street, it is just there. For opening hours see their website [http://www.outhouse.ie][4]
2. **Gay Men's Health Service**. The GMHS is located in Baggot Street Hospital, 18 Upper baggot Street, Dublin 4 which is very close to the Shelbourne hotel and Stephen's Green (It is an old building near the 39A stop). It is open on Tuesday and Wednesday from 5pm to 7pm and there are plenty of free condoms and packets of lube in the waiting room which you can take while you're waiting for your free STI check and/or Hep B vaccines. There are also little brown nondescript bags where you can put the condoms and lube you pick up which is good. Their website is here ([http://hse.ie/eng/services/list/5/sexhealth/gmhs/][5])
3. **The LGBTQ+ office**. The society have condoms in the office and also leave out a box of condoms and lube during our coffee mornings.
4. **Prhomo **- This is the night club UCD LGBTQ+ goes out to most, and never fear, if you forget to bring a condom and are in need of it you can get them at the cloakroom, which is nice because you're less likely to forget it when you leave.
5. **The George** - Condoms here are also available at the cloakroom (which is located upstairs).
6. **Pantibar** - named by the owner, drag queen Panti Bliss, this is a place not usually known for nights out with the society but we did go there once on a pub crawl, and it is really nice inside. Condoms used to be kept in a box by the windowsill but now they literally have two dispensers, one for condoms and the other for lube, on the wall by the stairs, so you have no excuse not to be protected. Again you can also go in for Rapid HIV Testing on Saturday and Sunday evenings, check out KnowNow on facebook for further details.
