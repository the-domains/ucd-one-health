'One Health' or 'One Medicine' proposes the unification of the medical and veterinary professions with the establishment of collaborative ventures in clinical care, surveillance and control of cross-species disease, education, and research into disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, therapy and vaccination. The concept encompasses the human population, domestic animals and wildlife and the impact that environmental changes ('environmental health') such as global warming will have on these populations.

We're in a privileged position in UCD to have Ireland's only Veterinary School, and with the medical school only a short walk away and the O'Brien Centre For Science and School of Agricultural Science in close proximity it's an ideal environment to have collaborative events attended by all parties.

Throughout the Year we have a series of talks, workshops and collaborative events with other societies that aim to show the scope of one Health and give plenty of food for thought (we also have food after some of our events!). We also attend a couple of international conferences in the year on One Health, which are good fun. 

Below we've shared a few articles that aim to provide more of an impression of One Health and its importance, remember you can drop in at any event and join at any time.
