<article style=""><h1>Where to Get Free STI Testing</h1><p>Being a student it can be tough to justify paying money on anything, and sometimes we put off getting tested because of cost. However, sexual health is important, and unprotected sex (sex without a condom) does carry its risks (see our guide on where to get free condoms), in particular but certainly not limited tomen who have sex with men (MSM). In this guide we'll go through some of the places that anybody can go to for FREE STI testing, and some extra places exclusively for MSM.</p></article>

Resources:

HIV Ireland have produced a fantastic guide to FREE HIV, STI, and Hepatitis testing in Ireland which you can see here ([http://www.dublinaidsalliance.ie/uploads/Publications/Get\_Tested\_Guide\_updated\_Feb2015.pdf][0]). Also STI tests are CONFIDENTIAL, meaning they will not be on your medical chart. More info on STI testing available here ([http://www.dublinaidsalliance.ie/uploads/Publications/DAA%20Testing%20Service%20Booklet%202013.pdf][1])

Where can I get checked?

As mentioned earlier, HIV Ireland has produced an excellent booklet available here ([http://www.dublinaidsalliance.ie/uploads/Publications/Get\_Tested\_Guide\_updated\_Feb2015.pdf][0]) on where you can get your FREE STI checks. We've just made a list of the places in Dublin that offer free testing, and when it is offered. It should be noted here that the first list is free for all, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation (including men who have sex with men), and the list after are two additional locations in Dublin that serve MSM exclusively (this is most likely because MSM is a high risk group for many STIs, most notably HIV - almost 50% of HIV cases are among MSM). Also note that some locations offer foreign language interpretation services. Alternatively the Student Health Service in the Student Centre also has an STI screening clinic, this service costs â‚¬80 and you can make an appointment in person or by ringing 01-7163133\. But all the places listed below are FREE, so there is really no need to go to the student centre.

Testing Clinics for Everybody (regardless of Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity)

The following four locations offer free STI and HIV testing to everybody at the given times, unless stated otherwise below (for example Beaumont only offers HIV testing as mentioned under the Beaumont heading). These are also walk in clinics (except Mater, which is by appointment only).

**HIV Ireland** (does STI testing as well as HIV testing - regardless of the name)

Located at 70 Eccles Street, Dublin 7 which is opposite the Mater hospital (up O'Connell Street up Parnell Street direction)

Telephone: (01) 873 3799 Website: www.hivireland.ie

Walk-in Clinic: 2nd Wednesday of every month Doors open 1:00pm Places are limited and allocated on a first come first served basis. Also HIV Ireland have free condoms so you can get those while you're there as well. Recent developments mean that HIV Ireland now have a very fancy waiting system, where you can register or check in on your smartphone or on a tablet they provide, and it will tell you how long till you are called, so if it is an hour let's say you can go to the shop etc. and check your phone to see how long you've left to wait. They also have an STI quiz that you can play on the tablet either while you're waiting, and it gives you the correct answer straight away so you can be educating yourself at the same time as waiting!

**St. James's Hospital, GUIDE Clinic James's Street, Dublin 8**

Telephone: (01) 4162315 (01) 4162316

Website: www.guideclinic.ie

Walk in Clinics: Mondays from 9:00am. (Present at 8:00am for tickets) Tuesday and Thursday from 1:30pm (Present from 8:30am for tickets and return in the afternoon for the clinic)

Note that this service is also open on Friday from 9am to 1pm but you can only go in at these times by appointment only (must be referred by a GP), whereas the Monday to Thursday times are walk in.

**Mater Hospital Infectious Diseases Unit**

The Mater Hospital is also located on Eccles Street, Dublin 7 and the clinic is located in the infectious diseases unit (sounds lovely I know). The thing about this one is that testing is by appointment only, rather than it being a walk in service.

Telephone: (01) 8032063 By appointment only: Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays 1:45pm to 6:00pm

**Beaumont Hospital Department of Infectious Diseases Beaumont Road, Dublin 9**

Telephone: (01) 8093006 Walk-in Clinic (or by appointment): Thursdays 10:00am to 12 noon (Note: HIV testing only clinic)

## Additional Testing Clinics for Men who have sex with men (MSM):

There are a few additional testing clinics for MSM, the GMHS in Baggot Street and the GMHS Outreach clinic at Outhouse Community centre have been running for years, and in addition KnowNow has recently began running rapid testing service in PantiBar on Saturday and Sunday evenings, and even more recently in the George on Tuesday evenings.

## KnowNow:

To keep up to date on where and when KnowNow are doing testing, the best thing is to keep track on their facebook page shown above. The idea behind the service is to remove the barriers to testing, one of which is the nervousness and reluctance that can be behind not wanting to go to a clinic or hospital. By locating themselves in well known Gay Bars, you can have a quiet one while you're waiting to go for testing downstairs (literally downstairs in PantiBar) and maybe even have the craic with a few others. Like in most/all of the places mentioned so far, prior to the test itself there is a precounselling session where they go through the consequences of the result and the services available. To reiterate, all HIV treatment is free in Ireland, regardless of your nationality, and going on treatment early improves your health and also reduces your risk of onward transmission.

KnowNow is also especially good as it uses a Rapid Testing Kit, so the actual testing is just taking a little bit of blood from your finger and has the result in about thirty seconds, which is really quick!
