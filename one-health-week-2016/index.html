<h1>One Health Week 2016!</h1><p>Our Flagship event of the year, we&apos;ve done a quick recap of the events we had for One Health Week last year.</p></article><p><strong>Our First event of the week, held on April 11th, began with a talk on Diabetes in Animals and Humans, given jointly by Prof Donal O Shea (Consultant Endocrinologist in St. Vincent’s University Hospital in Dublin) and Dr. Carmel Mooney (Small Animals Clinician at UCD Veterinary Clinical Science Department).</strong></p><p>Prof O’Shea began by describing the link between obesity and type II diabetes in humans, explaining what is meant by an obesogenic environment and how our habits and culture shape our response to this disease. It was then onto Dr Mooney to describe Diabetes in Cats, how they differ to humans both in their experience of the disease, the variability of the disease within different species and the approaches taken by pet owners.</p><picture>

<p>Following this, in line with the one health approach, there was dialogue between human and animal doctors and questions for the audience. Many interesting learning points were raised such as an obesogenic environment created by pet owners and the subsequent rise in diabetes in cats, the uptake of euthanasia as one of the outcomes of diagnosis in cats, and different areas where we could learn from each other both in terms of treatment and in understanding the nature of the disease.</p><picture>

<p><strong>Our next event, held on April 12th in the Veterinary Building, was a suturing practical with Dr Rackard (Associate Dean for Teaching and Learning and Director of Continuing Education in School of Veterinary Medicine) and Professor Cahill (Professor of Surgery in School of Medicine).</strong></p><picture>

<p>This was a very interactive event where there was great engagement from both the medical and veterinary students.</p><p><strong>Later that day on April 12th, we had a talk on Zoonotic Diseases in the case of travelling with Dr Barry (Lecturer in School of Veterinary Medicine).</strong></p><p><strong><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/iXBNu13vy68hI1gjvqy1YIJwOssM7M1qJW0dopUxMrKl-ydbnaHwbKaQ-mBXtihqTOhOsI8e945Wd7E8PLoGJzIlXOKYeQaG7FrvlPtqdQCcCDyfJ_7vtiQANYBZnsWMgH5XRfO4" alt="Zoonotic Disease.jpg"></strong></p><p>During this talk we focused on many of the zoonotic diseases that people can pick up while abroad, and focused in on the hot topic of the zika virus. The One Health Approach was brought up often, especially in how collaboration is best to tackle the epidemiology of these diseases and implement good surveillance and strategies for reducing incidence in addition to treating these diseases.</p><p><strong>On Wednesday April 13th we held a very interesting talk on Antimicrobial Resistance in Wildlife by Dr. McMahon (Lecturer in Wildlife Conservation, Zoonotic Epidemiology, Agricultural Ecology and Wildlife Management).</strong></p><p><strong><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/RtM6OE2rysCBxK0Hx95UVJO7hT1XsPPJqMQWVT58QXesXK2v3gqZm-UG89qH3I21qjWOhhikbhW3_Z2GH0sDGqSMUM17rlJcPV6GSDrLhvyhPE_Cc3Gsf6b17zXNssu8YwCNHH6e" alt="Birds.jpg"></strong></p><p>This brought in the environmental aspect of the One Health approach, and spoke about common resistant bacterial strains such as MRSA and how they were reflected in local bird reservoirs.</p><p>The event brought home the message of wildlife and environmental scientists and vets working together with medical doctors to try reduce transmission of these resistant bacterial strains, and also how patterns of migration of birds and climate change influence transmission. It was particularly powerful as the speaker himself works with Swedish medical doctors on this issue, so it was a showcase of the One Health Approach in action.</p><picture>

<p>The event began with a description of some of the challenges experienced by veterinary surgeons which would likely not be encountered in human medicine, such as safety in getting kicked and the challenge of maintaining a sterile environment in a farmplace.</p><p>Prof Cahill then spoke of some of the challenges in human medicine, along with many of the opportunities, and how we could learn much from collaborating with veterinary surgeons.</p><p>Then it was down to business, practicing the basic stitching techniques on simulated animal skin, observing some of the medical surgeons performing stitches on artificial horse legs, and generally having fun in a productive environment.</p><p><strong>Later that day on Wednesday April 13th we held a comparative anatomy practical with Dr. Kilroy (Professor of Anatomy in School of Veterinary Medicine) and Dr. Koelle (Professor of Anatomy in School of Medicine).</strong></p><p>This again was very fun and interactive, and we got to see lots of the similarities and differences between animal and human anatomy. I think many of the medical students were surprised at how similar the anatomy was in terms of how the terminology and language of anatomy translated easily between species. One of the great successes of the event was removing the fear held by some medical students that familiarizing themselves with the anatomy of other species must be an incredibly daunting task, as anatomy makes up a large chunk of the initial courses in medical school. For the veterinary students, there was also lots to learn from Dr Koelle who focused particularly on reproductive Anatomy. We were also particularly fortunate as Dr Koelle is qualified as both a vet and medical doctor, and so could easily integrate the One Health Approach in her teaching and discussion.</p><p><strong>Our last event of the week was held on April 14th, and this was on the Rabies eradication program of Worldwide Veterinary Services by James Florence (Managing Director of WVS).</strong></p><p>James Florence joined Worldwide Veterinary Service at the beginning of 2010, after spending 8 years in Africa working on a number of different wildlife conservation projects. He established Zambia’s only elephant orphanage and rehabilitation centre. At WVS, he oversees all aspects of the charity's day-to-day operations, while generating long-term strategies and plans for the growth of the organisation.</p><p>This was a very popular event, as Rabies is a very serious condition both for humans and animals, and as the speaker was part of an organization many veterinary students in the College volunteer with. There was much to be learned from both the medical and veterinary perspective, particularly when it came to the epidemiology of the disease and how the organization was using new and innovative techniques such as GPS tracking on mobile devices to monitor their surveillance.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b95f6e92d124f54a9fb390c47a68b993fe2906a3.png"><p>We also held a debate on AntiMicrobial Resistance during the week.</p><p>"This House holds that the irresponsible use of anti-microbials in veterinary medicine has been a major element in the development of anti-microbial resistance in pathogens of man."<br>This Debate is very relavent to all disciplines under the One Health Umbrella. So we have invited a few professionals who have experience with this topic and one of them is the Dean of the Veterinary School. It should be interesting and funny with questions from the audience and other professors! There will be coffee/tea before and refreshments after! <br>Professor Seamus Fanning, Graduated as a Biochemist and completed his PhD in Molecular Microbiology. He is a Professor of Food Safety and Zoonoses and the Director of the UCD Centre for Food Safety.<br>Dr. James Gibbons, graduated with a Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine at UCD, and completed his PhD in Veterinary Microbiology.
